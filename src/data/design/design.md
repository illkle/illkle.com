# Design

Before moving into development in 2021, I worked at motion design & 3d graphics for about 4 years.

I started seriously learning it in mid 2016, went freelancing in early 2018.

All these projects are from 2017-2019. In the middle of 2019 I got a production studio jo. 

I did some cool stuff there too but it's under NDA unfortunatelly.
